Secure WordPress wp-admin Using .htpasswd
This method adds an extra password layer to your WordPress admin login.

Step 1: Create the .htpasswd File
Open your WordPress root directory (where wp-config.php is located).
Create a new file named: .htpasswd
Add your desired username and password inside it in this format:

username:password

Save the file.

Step 2: Find the Full File Path of .htpasswd
In the same directory, create a new file named: test.php
Paste this code inside:

<?php
echo dirname(__FILE__) . '/.htpasswd';
?>

Open this file in your browser:
https://yourdomain.com/test.php
Copy the full path that appears on the screen.
Delete the test.php file for security.


Step 3: Protect the wp-admin Folder
Open your wp-admin directory.
Create a new file named: .htaccess
Paste the following code inside:

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Area"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user

Replace /path/to/.htpasswd with the full file path you copied in Step 2.

Setup Complete
Now when you go to:

https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin

You will be asked to enter the username and password you placed in .htpasswd.
This provides an additional security layer to protect your WordPress admin panel.
